<p>When I was 18 I got caught with some weed in my car and had to go to treatment. During that time, multiple people asked me for a comprehensive personal drug history. Every use, of everything. Like most addicts I couldn't really give them an accurate reading. All I could do is give them was a vague memory of all my vices. </p>

<p>Decades later I would try to solve this issue by attempting to create a drug use log that would remember all of your vices. Give a comprehensive history of all the substances you've consumed.</p>

<p>As soon as I decided I was going to learn to code, I needed to come up with some game and app ideas. This is my first attempt at submitting an app to the Apple App store.</p>
