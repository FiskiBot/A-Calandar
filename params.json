Every use, of everything. Like most addicts I couldn't really give them an accurate reading. All I could do is give them was a vague memory of all my vices. \r\n\r\nDecades later I would try to solve this issue by attempting to create a drug use log that would remember all of your vices. Give a comprehensive history of all the substances you've consumed.\r\n \r\nAs soon as I decided I was going to learn to code, I needed to come up with some game and app ideas. This is my first attempt at submitting an app to the Apple App store.\r\n",
